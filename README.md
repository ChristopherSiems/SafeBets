# SafeBets

**SafeBets is a is a proof-of-concept minimum-viable-product sports betting and investing app.**

Sports betting has taken over America, for better or worse it is likely here to stay. An undeniable property of the popularity of sports betting is that many people are going to lose a lot of money. But what if there was some way to have most of the fun of sports betting without all of that loss? This is where SafeBets comes in.

SafeBets is a sports betting app allowing users to deposit money to get tokens to bet with. These tokens can be wagered on the outcome of sports games. The catch is, the tokens cannot be withdrawn for cash. Instead the tokens remain in the system. So why would anyone use a betting app that they can't withdraw from? Because there is more to SafeBets. When cash is deposited, users get "valueless" tokens and their money is swept to the prototype's other main feature: the portfolio. The portfolio allows the user to select a mix of safe-bet assets to invest their cash in and when cash is deposited, it is divided evenly among the assets in the mix.

This model presents a possible solution to the problem statement of the project: users get the opportunity to have fun betting on sports without the loss, while at the same time, users build a portfolio of safe assets.

This project was built for Clarkathon2025 hosted by the Clark Community Computing Club and Technology, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship at Clark University.
